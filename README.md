# My Portfolio Page

* A responsive portfolio page project with Javascript via emailjs to enable interactivity to send me emails directly from the Contact page, as well as a vanilla JS file to toggle between light and dark themes.

## Live link

### Special Thanks

* Cory Kane for guiding me with helpful suggestions and emailjs.com in setting up the direct email feature in the JS file.
